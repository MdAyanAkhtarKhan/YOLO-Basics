YOLO-Basics 🚀

This project is the first step toward real-world applications using YOLO (You Only Look Once).
It is designed for beginners who want to understand how object detection works using YOLO with minimal setup.
The repository contains two Python scripts:
One for real-time detection using a webcam
One for object detection on a single image
I hope this helps you get started with YOLO and computer vision.

📌 Features

Real-time object detection using webcam
Object detection on static images
Easy-to-understand and beginner-friendly code
